This code defines a React functional component for a simple Next.js page that displays a counter with increment and decrement buttons. It uses React's useState hook to manage the counter state, initializing it to zero. The UI includes a heading, a descriptive paragraph, and two buttons styled with Tailwind CSS classes: one intended to decrement and one to increment the counter. The current count is displayed between the buttons. The layout centers the content vertically and horizontally on the page with a light gray background and dark text. Note: there is a bug where both buttons increment the count instead of one decrementing it.
